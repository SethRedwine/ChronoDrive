# Introduction

This is a simple client for file storage and synchronization that utilizes the NDN architecture.

## Development: Getting Started

Ensure you are set up with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local machine. Just follow the link and use their handy installer.

Once node is set up download the files in this repository. Then open up your command prompt and navigate to the same directory as the package.json.

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run ng:serve:web`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:linux`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable on linux system |
|`npm run electron:windows`| On a Windows OS, builds your application and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems |
|`npm run electron:mac`|  On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Mac |
|`npm run electron:arm7`|  On an arm based pc, builds your application and generates a `.AppImage` file of your application that can be run on things like a Raspberry Pi (running arm7l)|
|`npm run electron:arm6`|  On an arm based pc, builds your application and generates a `.AppImage` file of your application that can be run on things like a Raspberry Pi (running arm64)|

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

### Install on linux

App for linux is distributed in AppImage format. Install it with command line:

```
chmod a+x <<release_name>>.AppImage # make executable
./<<release_name>>.AppImage # install and run
```

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread ?

You can do this! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies (not devDependencies) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to the final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file. Easy no ?

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload ? You can do it with `npm run ng:serve:web`.
**Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case.** Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.
